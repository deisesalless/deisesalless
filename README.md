### 👩‍💻 Hi there! I'm Deise

I'm a software engineer and I like working in backend development. I enjoy learning new technologies and understanding how these tools work. Putting my knowledge into practice is my superpower 😄 I love seeing how technology impacts humanity and how people use these tools in their daily lives.

Here you'll see my projects with **Java** and **Python**. Sometimes, you'll find other technologies too.  
Currently, my focus is backend with Java and Python — but when I try to learn frontend, I cry 😅  
(colors and their harmony are just not my thing hahaha)

So... enjoy, and be careful! 🚀

### 🛠️ Techs I use

**BackEnd:** Java • Spring • SQL • MySQL • PostgreSQL  
**FrontEnd:** Flet • HTML • CSS  
**Version Control:** Git  
**Other:** Docker • Flyway Migrations • Swagger
